To add components from v0.dev need to 
1. create new layout.tsx and page.tsx files 
2. copy the ui folder in path folder
3. copy component.tsx file contents in page.tsx file
4. copy layout.tsx file into layout.tsx
5. ensure that the type of the child is specified (code below):

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode; // need to define children explicitly, which is done here
}>) {
    return (
        // whatever is inside return
    )
}

6. use gpt to combine global.css files
7. use gpt to combine tailwind.config.ts files 
8. resolve any errors in package.json
-> only need to do css steps once if theme is the same
-> of css different however then u need to add new global.css in different component folders
